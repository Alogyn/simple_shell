# 0x16. C - Simple Shell - Low-level programming Group Project

Welcome to the ALX Low-Level Programming repository for the 'C - Simple Shell' project. In this challenging endeavor, you will undertake the creation of a simple Unix shell in the C programming language. A shell is the interface that allows users to interact with the operating system, executing commands and managing processes. This project is a comprehensive exploration of system calls, process creation, and command execution. This repository serves as your command center, containing scripts and C programs essential for developing your very own simple shell. Get ready to immerse yourself in the world of system programming as you design and implement a functional and efficient shell in C.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this project, you will:

- Understand the process of command execution in a shell, including parsing user input, creating child processes, and executing commands using system calls such as `fork`, `execvp`, and `wait`.
- Learn how to parse user input to extract command and argument information. Explore techniques for tokenizing input strings and handling whitespace.
- Implement built-in commands such as `cd` and `exit` within the shell, allowing users to navigate directories and gracefully exit the shell.
- Explore file I/O redirection and pipes to enable users to redirect input and output streams, as well as chain commands together.
- Implement signal handling to handle signals such as `Ctrl+C` (SIGINT) and `Ctrl+Z` (SIGTSTP), allowing users to interrupt or suspend command execution.
